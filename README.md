The csv-data module expects to find CSVs of price data in
the csv directory at the top level of the project. The naming
convention for these files is [symbolName]-[mm/dd/yyy].csv or [option name].csv

The data format should look something like
Date, Time, Open, High, Low, Close, Volume
03/09/2015, 08:30, 121.3700, 121.5300, 121.3300, 121.5000, 236330.0000
